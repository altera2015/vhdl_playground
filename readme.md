VHDL playground
===============
VHDL playground can be used to learn VHDL without immediately investing in hardware. 
Compilation, simulation and visualization are all done with Open Source sofware.


Prerequisists
-------------
Download GHDL
https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl/releases/download/v0.36/ghdl-0.36-mingw32-mcode.zip

To see the signals download GtkWave
https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/files/gtkwave-3.3.100-bin-win64/


Building & Running
==================
Once you write your VHDL scripts all you need is to run make.

To see the values of the signals run view, view takes 1 parameter which is the .vcd file to inspect.
